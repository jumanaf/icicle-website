*I love solving hard problems with speed and accuracy.*


I'm a data scientist and machine learning engineer, with experience in full-stack engineering, building automations to scale companies, and pulling insights from raw data through publication-ready visualizations and statistical analyses.

My experience is in both hard-tech startups and academia. 
* I did my undergraduate degree in the University of Washington (Bioengineering + Data Science), where I was an undergrad researcher in the [Kueh](https://depts.washington.edu/kuehlab/) and Beliveau labs. 
* I spent three years at [Dyno Therapeutics](https://www.dynotx.com/), scaling the computational team to accelerate the discovery and licensing of gene therapies. 
* I've spent the past year as the Chief AI Officer at [Kiwi Charge](https://www.kiwicharge.ca/), an EV charging startup. I lead the strategy and implementation for software, cybersecurity, and machine learning.

My strength is in **distilling complex data and technology into actionable and accessible insights**. My interdisciplinary background allows me to communicate with people from diverse tech/non-tech backgrounds, and help bring people's ideas into reality.
